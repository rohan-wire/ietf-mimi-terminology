# Introduction

The More Instant Messaging Interoperability (MIMI) working group is chartered to
specify the minimal set of mechanisms to make modern instant messaging applications
interoperable. Through prior discussions and upcoming documents, it's become important
to have a shared understanding for what is being discussed specifically.

This document aims to neutrally describe each part of an interoperable instant messaging
application. Note that some terminology comes from MIMI's use of MLS. [!I-D.ietf-mls-architecture]
